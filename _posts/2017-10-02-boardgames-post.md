## Noughts And Crosses

Noughts and Crosses also known as Tic-Tac-Toe, is a fairly common tabletop game which can be played by pretty much medium. It simply requires two people, a drawn out three by three grid and two types of counters. In most cases the game is simply played by drawing the grid on a piece of paper and placing noughts or crosses in the grid as the game progresses. The aim of the game being to place three of your counters (Noughts for one player, Crosses for the other) in a row by playing with alternating turns between players. However often this can result in a tie and neither player being able to create a line of three.
While the origins of noughts and crosses is unknown it's thought to have been played as far back as by the ancient Egyptians and the Romans. Noughts and crosses appears to be a relatively simple game due to the simplicity of the game board and the speed of gameplay however its very easy to find yourself stratagising placement of your counter when your turn rolls around. The games main objecting is to match three counters in a row however it very quickly turns into a game to try and prevent your opponent from matching three of their counters at the same time. Thus it's likely for people to try and place counters in obselete places to try and trick their opponents into not seeing the emerging line.
Simple as it looks there are more than 200,000 outcomes for a game of nouughts and crosses showing that while lacking in aesthetics the game makes up for it in mechanics.

While studying the game our class was put in groups to play and determin the mechanics of the game before picking out its flaws and find our own way of improving the game in some way or another. 
Our group decided to maintain the original mechanics while simply adding more features. To begin with we upgraded the board to a four by four grid, this gave the players more to stratagise with and allowed for a smoother transition of our next addition. A third player, a "Joker" was introduced. This was the major change we made to the game. The Joker has their own set of rules while the other two players continue the game as normal. For each turn rotation the players would continue to try and match three of their counters in a row, the joker however would roll a six sided die for which each number has a different funtion, these included
moving a player piece, removing a player piece, placing a 'blocker' on the board (a counter used to prevent a line from being made, they can be placed anywhere the joker feels appropriate), remove a 'blocker', place two 'blockers' and move a blocker. The jokers aim is to prevent either of the other players from winning adding another layer of stratagy to the game. 
Much to our amusment when playing a prototype of the game we found it a whole load of fun, having a third player made it much more of a bluffing game, a player could only really win by creating an ultimatum for both the other player and the joker. The dice roll creates an aspect of randomness to the game making it different to play every time preventing the players from getting bored of playing. It does however cause the ability of the game to be played near anywhere with any mediums to be lost due to the dice roll, however dice are small enough to carry around without much effort thus we found this could be a relatively appropriate trade.

## Edward De Bono's The L Game

Edward De Bono's the L game according to his website was created with the intention to produce the simplest possible game to be played with a higher level of skill. The game appears simple with a four by four grid with two L shaped topped and talled in the center two collumns and a counter at the top corner of each L shapes outter collumn. 
The general rules of the game state that at the beginning of each players turn a player must first move their L shape in any rotation or placement of free spaces within the board and then may if they so wished move on of the neutral counters to any empty space on the board. The pieces could not intersect or overlap and the aim of the game is to prevent your opponent from being able to move their L shape by blocking them in using your own L shape and the neutral counters.
While the game appears relatively simple after playing for an amount of time it became very apparent that the game is harder to win than first belived, due to the nature of the game much like noughts and crosses playing against an opponent who knows how to play the game can become increasingly difficult due to both players making sure they do not meet the losing conditions. The L game has 2296 board variations that can be reached at any point during the game on any players turn, of these only 15 variations equal to a win condition and of each of these the losing piece is always touching a corner in one manner or another.
Because of this it's normal for players to begin to play in a form of mannerisms such as playing agressively, defensively or neutraly, this means that in order to win you'll likely need to figure out how your opponent is likely to play in order to corden them off, which is to put it lightly a lot easier said than done. While the game continues the player also needs to be able to play to avoid putting their own piece in dangerous places while still considering their opponents future movements. I found in this manner the game is very similar to chess, you can't just move your pieces and hope to win, every move should be carefully constructed to lead your opponent in a specific direction. Much like Ballroom each player should "lead" their opponent into the positions for which they want them in order to win the game.

After playing the L game and finding it fustratingly difficult to play against someone with similar thought patterns our group strated thinking of smaller changes we could create in order to improve the gameplay, namely speed up the game as it became very apparent that the game could continue at a stalemate for an awfully long time in some games. 
In order to do this we used the neutral counters mechanic and simply extended it, extending the board by one row and collumn (Five by Five) we gave the players more space to work with in order to balance out the new mechanic. Rather than having two neutral counters on the board each counter could be assigned to a player, for each players turn they would move their L shape as usual however rather than moveing their counter they would add another counter to an adjacent square. By extending the grid we eliminated the fact that it was possible to block out all win conditions by simply covering the corners and by altering the counter mechanic the game became much swifter.
Rather than playing endlessly because you and your opponent can read each other too well you would increasingly run out of space increasing the pressure causing players to overlook things, it also makes it possible for players to place counters which could block themselves in causing the other player to win.
After play testing this variation we found that it maintained the complexity of the original while reducing the lack of interest caused by long games making it ever so slightly more enjoyable to play.
