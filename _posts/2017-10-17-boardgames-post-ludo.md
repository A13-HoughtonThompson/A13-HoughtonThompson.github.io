## The Original

Ludo is a casual strategy board game for two to four players based around a king of the hill style race. With a more complex board than the games we previously had looked at the game becomes significantly longer. Ludo is pretty much all luck based, players start with their 4 characters within their outer square of the board, each player is assigned a colour with determines which corner of the board they start in.
A die is rolled to start the game and the player with the highest roll starts the game, upon each players’ turn the die is rolled again, to begin a player cannot move a character out of their initial square until they roll a 6 on the die, this applies for each time the player wishes to start a new character on the game board. 
For each turn the die is rolled and the outcome determines the number of squares that player can move a character.
When a player character ends its movement on a square occupied by another character the character that occupied the square to begin with is returned to its players hand. If a player rolls a 6 while all characters are already functioning it earns the player a “bonus” roll that turn, if another 6 is rolled after the turn ends and gameplay continues as usual. The game is over when a player has brought all their tokens to the centre of the gameboard.
While this game appears more colourful and bright after our group had played it for a good while we all unanimously agreed that it was too drawn out with no skill involved. This made for rather boring gameplay since you couldn’t choose any aspects of the game once it started. Thus, we began without if finishing one game to edit the rules to make the game more enjoyable.

## Alteration One
> As simple as we could bare to go...

Once we began to alter the game we found that a lot of the things we tried didn’t work, such as changing the gameboard or removing the dice rolls and allowing players to choose how many squares they moved if it was within six or less. In the end we designed two alterations to the classic ludo.
The first alteration was relatively simple, keeping the board next to the original we added an extra lane between each train of the map creating shortcuts between the lanes, this gave players a choice as to whether they found the shortcut useful or not and to prevent excessive backlogging. Next, we decided to scrap the roll six to start a piece and allowed players to start them at any point they desired during their turn, this would however count as their whole turn.
We implemented new rules, the main of which being that player characters Could not overtake characters of other colours while if a player rolled onto the same square as another player the original character would be returned to the starting box as per usual. The next rule was that only one piece needed to reach the centre in order for a player to win the game, this cut game time to prevent players from getting bored while also allowing for more dramatic gameplay. 
Finally, the largest change we made was to the final stretch of the game board. Once a player character made it the whole way around the board their turn would end upon the original starting square, this would in essence open the central stretch to the centre of the game board, however if another player character lands on the same opening square while the first player is still on the final stretch the original player piece is returned to the starting box
and the second player can now take their place on the centre stretch, this applies to any players any amount of times. This made the last stretch of the game more pressured, picking up players waning attention the game suddenly becomes less of a war game and more of a team game to prevent the player in the lead from winning the game. This is because the more player characters that are on the board the more chance there is someone could roll to “kick” the lead back to the beginning. 
These relatively simple addons and alterations gave the game a manner of player skill and strategy, you could easily block other players from moving forward using your own characters while still advancing but at the same time it was entertaining to see how the dice rolls would favour people. After playtesting for a good while we found that everyone playing was laughing and enjoying themselves, something we found didn’t happen playing the original, 
we also found that when our attention started to wane the alterations of the final stretch brought attention and the fun back to the game board while not lengthening the game time too much. These changes simple gave the game an allowance for strategy while maintaining the fun from the luck found in rolling a dice.

## Our Own King Of The Hill

Our second version was much more complicated in terms of gameplay while still maintaining a link to the original game. The gameboard retained some similarities in terms of spacing, we kept the idea that there would be four starting area’s however we moved these off the main board and to a space outside it while still having intersections. 
Each player would start within their designated corner and the set-up stage would begin, a deck of cards with encounters would be drawn by each player to fill the event spaces on their corner of the board. This corner essentially becomes that players own stronghold, where the cards are placed is up to the player and as each player passes through another players area they will have to engage with cards they land on. 
Movement remains the same as the original ludo, a six-sided dice is rolled to move however we removed the roll a six to start your character on the board.
Some encounters will give that player a “buff” which they can use against other players or to aid themselves as they move around the board for example, when a player lands on an occupied space they are given the choice to attack that player or ignore them. Should they choose to attack they would use “buff” cards to enhance dice rolls and/or the person being attacked could play a card protecting them from attacks. 
The board game involves the outer squares in which players will start, an inner circle and “the Hill” or winning space. Spaces within the inner circle would have set encounters and set squares intersecting with the player squares allowing them to move from outer rings to the inner one. This also applies for the inner ring connecting to the hill, only specific squares with encounter cards allow a player to access the hill and once they’re that player stops taking turns.
A player needs to be in control of the hill for several turns before they win the game, this allows other players to contest while the game is still underway preventing a solid “end phase”. It’s likely that a player could be removed from the hill resetting the countdown many times before someone finally wins. 
This gives the game more depth and gives the player much more control over how the game plays out. As players can move between the player squares and inner ring as much as they want they can stack “buffs” making them less vulnerable during play. While this is the case the luck based element from the original ludo game is maintained via the dice roll. While a player can control how to interact with the board they cannot chose what they need to interact with. 
This version too many trials and errors to take form. We attempted many changes such as lengthening the board or rearranging it before deciding it would be easier to simply redesign it altogether. The same applies to the player characters, we entertained the idea of simply having one player character available during the entire game, however due to the size of the board and the amount of options the players are given this lengthened gameplay a little more than was comfortable. 
In the end the version we came up with after playtesting was entertaining and surprising, keeping our attention on both the board and the other players movement.
