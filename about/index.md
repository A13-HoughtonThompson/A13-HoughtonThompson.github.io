## About Me

# --The tale of how I became addicted to clicking buttons...--

I suppose I should start at the beginning. For me, like many others I'm sure, it started with microsoft...The Xbox 360, to me was a holy grail of entertainment and procrastination giving me one of the few things the real world never gave. Friends. 
That's right, little Ayesha was awful at talking to people..Panicky and nervous even the slightest interaction was for me, just a little too much. These wonderful aesthetic digital worlds however were everything a shy girl could ever ask for. 
I could enjoy talking to people who didn't care about my real name, how old I was or even my gender and ethnicity. For me games gave me the confidence to stand up for myself and interact with the outside world. (Mostly through boasting over my rankings in the infamous Halo 3 or Call Of Duty: Black Ops..But heck it could have been worse).
By the time I finished high school I was hooked. I wanted to know everything about every game I could get my hands on. The best way to use a sniper in an FPS, the fastest way to win a game of Civilisation without inducing a war or making any enemies. There was so much to learn and so little time.
From there the depth of which I searched for knowladge grew and grew until....University. Who would have known, little ol' me managed to somehow around the obsessive disection of games make my way here to the place of my dreams. 
What else could I ever want? Surrounded by people with the same hobbies and very likely the same lack of social skills I could be me. But, what about more than that? Games don't need to stop at just entertainment do they. Of course not.

I've learned an awful lot about a lot of terrible things the world can throw at you in the years I've managed to retain information and as before games even corrupted my internal hard drives with their perfect distractions, I will always want to find a way to lessen those horrible things for others just as games did for me.
So here I am learning and learning with the hope that someday I'll be able to make a worldspace that will, in anyway, provide not just entertainment but help for anyone who, even for a moment, wants to step into someone elses shoes.

## Hobbies:

> Games (Obviously)
~~~~~~~~~
I may have what some would call a...
> slight 
addiction...and by slight I mean I spend as much time surrounded by games as I do every other hobby or commitment. Sleep is not necissary when your saving Skyrim after all~
 
> Reading 
~~~~~~~~~
Horror is my genera. There is nothing better in a book for me than the heart retching plot twists that horror provides. If I had to recommend anything? The Red Eye series is still my all time favorite collection. If I'm honest I read every single one in a single sitting...
Yeah...they really are 
> just that good.

> Photography
~~~~~~~~~
Animals and portraits are my game. I have a strange fasination with the way living things appear, be it a hyacinth, a bumble bee, a butterfly, a crow or a fellow student, through a lense everything can become beautiful as it is.

> Art
~~~~~~~~~
Ever since I was little I loved drawing, scribbling on anything I could get my hands on. My over active imagination lets me doodle all the time. Though over the years a more Middle Eastern and Japanese Anime like style has been adopted...What can I say, Sailor Moon is still my Idol.
